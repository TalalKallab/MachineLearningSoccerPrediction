# Soccer League Prediction and Simulation Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a full soccer league season using machine learning models to predict match outcomes and goals. The simulation is based on historical data from La Liga, including team performance, goals scored, assists, and clean sheets. The main objective is to generate accurate league standings based on simulated matches between all participating teams.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Historical match results and team statistics are collected from various reliable sources, including:
   - [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/laliga/weisseWeste/wettbewerb/ES1/saison_id/1995#google_vignette)
   - [FBRef (2016-2017 Season)](https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/2016-2017/2016-2017-La-Liga-Stats)
   - [Kaggle Dataset (1995-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kishan305/la-liga-results-19952020)
   - [FBRef (La Liga Seasons History)](https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/history/La-Liga-Seasons)

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw data is cleaned and merged to create comprehensive datasets, containing match results, team statistics, and player achievements.

3. **Model Training:** 
   - Machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier and Regressors) are trained to predict:
     - Match results (win, draw, lose)
     - Home and away goals
   - Models are trained using features like team IDs, top scorers, assist leaders, clean sheet statistics, and champion points.

4. **League Simulation:** 
   - Matches are simulated between all teams, and results are predicted using the trained models.
   - Points, wins, draws, losses, and goal statistics are updated to generate the final league table.

5. **Final Output:** 
   - The final standings are displayed and saved to a CSV file.
   - The complete simulation process is executed using the **`main.py`** script.

## Benefits and Applications
- **Predictive Analysis:** Analyze potential outcomes of soccer seasons based on historical data.
- **Performance Tracking:** Understand team dynamics and performance across seasons.
- **Data Insights:** Leverage data-driven insights for better sports analytics.

## Project Structure
The project consists of four primary scripts:
1. **train_model.py:** Trains machine learning models.
2. **predict.py:** Predicts match outcomes and goals.
3. **simulate_match.py:** Simulates individual matches.
4. **simulate_league.py:** Simulates the entire league season.

## Conclusion
This project combines machine learning with soccer analytics to predict and simulate an entire season of La Liga matches. The use of historical data and predictive modeling provides insights into team performance and league outcomes. The generated league table offers an accurate representation of simulated results.
